# Working in a group

Working in a large group can be tricky. There are a number of problems you can
run into right off the bat when starting a group project. There can be clashing
personalities, different ideas, different workflows, different habits. I found it
to be very useful to have a very thorough setup before you actually start mashing
away in your favorite code editor.

## Setup

The first thing me and my Meesterproef group did when we started off is to do an
individual debrief. What is your perception of the project? What ideas do you have
in mind already, if any? Sit (or stand if you're the healthy type) around with your
project group to talk about the debrief. I found it best to let everyone have a say
and to stay open-minded. It can be useful to have everyone on the team share what
they want to learn during the project. This can be beneficial for when you go
about setting roles within your group.

## Methods

It can be useful to stick to some methods during the project. This can give some
much needed structure to a possibly chaotic group project. It has to be said,
almost every single one of the members in our project group dreaded the idea of
working in a group of six. Though, starting of with [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) (our own twisted
version) did give us a lot of hope starting off. We started off by writing all
the tasks on sticky-notes, sorted by 'Front-end', 'Design' and 'Back-end'. This
made it easier to assign group members to tasks.

## Workflow

We (obviously) chose to work on Github. It is important to decide how to go about working in a group. We decided to work component-based. Meaning we divide everything up in individual components. Everyone works on a component. This gives everybody the opportunity to leave their own mark or signature on the entire project.

## Keep at it

>'Do we really need to stand up? Can't we just have a "Sit-down"?'.

It is essential that you keep at it when it comes to the methods you pick. If the methods don't work for your particular team, sure, switch it up. Make sure you don't slack off as a team. Things like 'Stand-ups' seem lame, but are an essential part of communication within the team. It's really important to know what everybody is doing and how things go individually.

## So..

Stick to the methods, communication is key, a good setup is a job half done, give and take, stay open-minded.
